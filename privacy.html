          Information about your transactions and experiences with us and
          others, such as your payment history, claims, coverage, and vehicle

          about you from consumer reporting agencies, which provide us with
          motor vehicle reports, claim reports, and/or credit information where
          permitted by law. When you ask for a rate quotation, we may obtain
          credit information if permitted by applicable state law. Our sales and
          service representatives do not have access to the details of your
          credit information. Other companies who view your credit report will
          not see MEDICARE SOLUTIONS JOY inquiry. It will be visible only to you.

          credit information in connection with any renewal. LOCATION SERVICES
          Your current location is only used if you permit our services to do
          so. If you allow your location to be obtained using a MEDICARE SOLUTIONS JOY
          app, or with a browser, we will use this information to return your
          estimated location. We use this information solely to distinguish your

          information that you provided to us, our representative will make the
          appropriate adjustments to MEDICARE SOLUTIONS JOY’s records. If you wish to
          correct personal information provided to MEDICARE SOLUTIONS JOY by a third
          party (such as a credit rating agency) the representative will provide
          you with the applicable third party’s contact information. Upon the
          request of residents of other states, we will take reasonable steps to
          verify the accuracy of the personal information in our records. THE
          INFORMATION WE DISCLOSE Information about our customers or former
          customers will only be disclosed as permitted or required by law.
          Information about you that has been collected is maintained in your
          policy and or claims records. We use this Information to process and
          service your policy; to settle claims; with your consent; or as
          directed by you. We may also disclose it to persons or organizations
          as necessary to perform transactions you request or authorize.
          Information about our former customers and about individuals who have
          obtained quotes from us is safeguarded to the same extent as
          Information about our current policyholders. Following are some
          examples of how we may disclose Information: We must exchange
          Information about you with our agents, investigators, appraisers,
          attorneys, and other persons who are or will become involved in
          processing your application and servicing your policy or any claims
          you may make. When you are involved in a claim, policy information is
          provided to adjusters and the businesses that will repair your
          vehicle. We may share Information with persons or organizations that
          we have determined need the Information to perform a business,
          professional, or insurance function for us. These include businesses
          that help us with administrative functions. If the law in your state
          permits, we may share Information with financial institutions with
          which we have a joint-marketing agreement. All of these entities are
          obligated to keep the Information that we provide to them confidential
          and to use the Information only for the purpose for which the
          Information was provided. Information may be provided to organizations
          conducting actuarial research or audits. In this case, you will not be
          individually identified in any research report. The organization must
          agree not to redisclose the Information and the Information will be
          returned to us or destroyed when it is no longer needed. We may also

          <strong>NOTICE OF COLLECTION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS:</strong> In the
          12-month period prior to the effective date of this Privacy Policy, we
          have collected the following categories of personal information:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Personal identifiers such as a real name, alias, postal address,
            unique personal identifier, email address, telephone number,
            insurance policy number, account name, social security number,
            signature, gender, driver’s license number, physical
            characteristics, consumer status, and other similar identifiers. We
            collect this category of information directly from consumers—either
            online, by phone, or in person. An antifraud service provider may
            confirm the information a consumer has provided to us and give us
            additional personal identifiers in response. We may also receive
            personal identifiers from marketing service providers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Driving and claims history, including information about any prior
            accidents or insurance claims. We request this information directly
            from consumers, but also sometimes receive it from antifraud and
            risk-assessment service providers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vehicle information, such as a vehicle identification number (VIN),
            vehicle details, including any customizations, and vehicle photos.
            We collect this information directly from consumers, claimants, auto
            dealerships, body shops, and other service providers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Financial identifiers, such as a bank account number, credit card
            number, debit card number, or other financial information. We
            generally collect this information directly from consumers. On
            occasion, we may receive this information indirectly while handling
            claims.
          </li>
          <li>
            Medical information, such as details involving the injuries
            sustained in a car accident, the treatment for such injuries, as
            well as health insurance information. We receive this information
            either directly from consumers or their attorneys, or from
            medical-field third-parties, in accordance with state and federal
            law.
          </li>
          <li>
            Commercial information about consumer transactions and experiences
            with us and others, such as payment history, claims, coverage and
            vehicle changes. We may receive this information directly from
            consumers or through their online activities, and sometimes from
            third-party vendors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Internet or other electronic network-activity information, which may
            include commercial information, such as browsing history, online
            identifier(s), Internet Protocol address, search history, and
            information regarding a consumer’s interaction with an Internet Web
            site, application, or advertisement. We collect this information
            through a consumer’s use of our website or mobile application(s) and
            third-party partners such as analytics and marketing providers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Geolocation data. When a consumer asks us to, we may collect
            geolocation data. For example, you may use our mobile application to
            find a nearby body shop. We collect this data through our
            application(s).
          </li>
          <li>
            Audio, electronic, visual, or similar information, such as recorded
            statements, photos of damaged vehicles, videos of accident
            locations, and calls made to our customer service centers, which may
            be recorded. We receive this information directly from consumers or
            a claimant’s insurer, through police investigations (i.e. accident
            reports), and through fraud investigations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Professional or employment-related information in the form of
            business contact information and education or employment history,
            which we only use as permitted by law. We generally collect this
            information directly from consumers. On occasion, this information
            is provided to us by third-parties.
          </li>
          <li>
            Applicant and Employee information, in addition to information in
            the above categories, this information includes birth certificates
            (to validate dependents), passport numbers, access badge photos,
            background and screening data, and protected class characteristics.
            This information is used in accordance with state and federal laws
            and is shared with our human-resources service providers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inferences drawn from the information we collect when consumers
            visit our websites, use our mobile apps, or interact with us on our
            social media platforms, as well as information about consumer
            preferences and behavior that we collect on our websites and mobile
            apps.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We collect each of the above categories of information for a variety
          of purposes, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            For our core business purposes, such as providing quotes for
            insurance, processing applications (either for insurance or for
            employment), establishing and servicing policies, claims handling,
            providing customer support, and furnishing other insurance services.
            For example, we use information to verify the driving history and
            information of our applicants; complete billing, payment and
            reimbursement obligations; and prevent fraud.
          </li>
          <li>
            To assess and improve our product and service offerings, including
            the development of new products and services.

            To maintain and enhance the security of our systems, data, and

          Policy, we have disclosed all of the above categories of personal
          information to service providers that assist us in providing
          insurance-related services, which include offering quotes, processing
